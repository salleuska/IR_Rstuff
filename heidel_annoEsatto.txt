Davis, who was born in 1892 and died in 1964, was one of the pioneers of abstract painting in America
WSJ920115-0014	1913	His career coincides almost exactly with the first full impact of modernism in this country, following the ground-breaking Armory Show of 1913, which introduced artists such as Matisse, Picasso and Duchamp to the American public
